## Introduction

The field of data structures and algorithms forms the backbone of computer science. Understanding these concepts is crucial for building efficient and scalable software applications. This repository aims to provide an organized collection , implementations and explanations for a wide range of data structures and algorithms.

## Features

- Common Data Structure and Algorithm Implementations in Python
- Detailed explanation and comments to understand the implementations
- Example usage and test cases are provided for each of the implementations
Performance benchmarks for algorithms

## Data Structures

This section contains implementations of commonly used data structures , including but not limited to:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps

Each data structure is organized in its respective directory, containing implementation explanations, and usage examples. Additionally, you may find relevant performance analysis and comparisons to help you choose the right data structure for your specific use case.

## Algorithms

In this section, you'll find implementations of various algorithms, such as:

- Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Graph Algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm)
- Dynamic Programming Algorithms
- Divide and Conquer Algorithms

Similar to the data structures section, each algorithm has its dedicated directory with explanations, and examples. Additionally, we strive to provide complexity analysis and practical use cases for each algorithm.
